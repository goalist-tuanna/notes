Part 1:
The Optimizing Individual
1. Decision Tree
sunk cost, marginal analysis, 
Time
3.Risk: 
risk-loving, risk-averse, risk-neutral
expected value, variance, law of large number, adverse selection(Asymetric information)
4. From ONE TO SOME
comparative advantage
coase theorem
Efficent Market Hypothesis

Part 2
Strategic Interaction
6. Cake cutting: moving knife procedure,
Can we predict outcome of a game? (positive question)
Is the predicted outcome good? (normative question)

7. Pareto efficiency
Pareto improvement

8. Simultaneous-move games
pay-off matrix, dominant strategy
mutually destructive behavior(tragedy of the commons)
paradox of thrift
narrow perspective, broader perspective, unexpected benefits

9. Auction
An ascending auction
A descending auction
1st (or 2nd) price sealed-bid auction
true value (2nd, ascending), shade your bid (descending, 1st)
The Revenue Equivalence theorem

10. From SOME to MANY
Competitive market, monopoly, monopsony
Price-taker, price-theory NO STRATEGIC INTERACTION => Supply and Demand

Part 3
Market Interaction
11. Supply and Demand
Competitive market => single market price
market supply curve, market demand curve,
substitutes, complements
The Market equilibrium

12. Taxes
Legal incidence vs economic incidence
legal incidence not detemine who share the tax burden equally
==> elasticity

13. Margins
marginal cost curve
marginal benefit curve
up - down vs right-left

14. Elasticity
Changes in one variable effect different variable
Price elasticity of demand and supply
>1%: elastic, otherwise inelastic

15. Big Picture
Understand market's limitations
Protect competition
Give the market second chance: external cost, tax, cap, trade

16. Conclusion
Start => optimistic => competitive market => game theory 
=> monopoly, tragedy of common, asymmetric information
