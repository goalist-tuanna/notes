PART 1: A SINGLE MACROECONOMY

Chapter 1: Introduction
TWO BIG GOALS: 
1. Increasing living standard in the long run
Classic view: MACROECONOMY LIKE The classical view
2. BOOM AND BUSTS LIKE GREAT DEPRESSION
KEYNESIAN VIEW: government promote short-run stability

Chapter 2: Unemployment
recession (sick) - depression (deathbed)
Unemploymented (if you're active looking for a paying job and can't find one)
Discouraged workers
Three types: frictional, structural, cyclical
Minimum wage laws, Effiency wages => SUPPLY AND DEMAND => The price of labor 
Preserve jobs => rigidity => better to leave market alone
frictional + structural => natural rate of unemployment
cyclical : sticky wages

Chapter 3: Money
MONEY => FACILITATES TRADE
MONEY HAS VALUE because everybody believes that it does
long-run growth money is neutral
short-term, money policy => buy or sell bonds

Chapter 4: Inflation
Consumer Price Index (CPI) Representative bundle
Easy question : Why it happen => print money
Hard question: Why it matter? => money illusion => real price relative to the overall price level
Real interest rate => purchasing power (nominal term >< real interest)
Too much inflation => wage-price spiral (near double digits )
Deflation => dangrerous too, 
BEST TARGET => 2 - 3% inflation per year

Chapter 5: Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
The Value-Added Approach = Final Output - Imports
The National Income Approach = Labor Income + Capital Income
The Expenditure Approach (most common ways) = (C + I + G + Exports) - Imports
Two variations: 
Real GDP Adjust for Inflation => stable short-term, GDP deflator
Real GDP Per Capita Adjusts for inflation and population => Long-term,
GDP Ignores non-market issues: unpaid household labor, environmental quality, distribution,
==> Human Development Index: Life Expectancy, Literacy Rates, Quality of Life

Chapter 6: The Role of Goverment
Monetary Policy
Fiscal Policy ==> Long-Run Government DEBT
Promote Long-run growth: property right, promoting innovation and protecting competition,
investment in infrastructure and education, dealing with pollution, alleviate poverty.
Goverment ALSO optimizing individuals : PUBLIC CHOICE THEORY
SUPPLY-SIDE ECONOMISTS, 
Government spending as % GDP, government regulations, balance between jungle and zoo.
Micromanaging is a bad idea.

Part Two: International Trade

Chapter 7: Trade and Technology
FACT 1: Technological progress create loseras as well as winners.
FACT 2: Technological progress is pretty awesome
FACT 3: Technological progress and trade are essentially indistinguishable

Chapter 8: The Classical View of Trade
SIMPLE And POWERFUL
VIEW AS A WELL-ORGANIZED FAMILY

Chapter 9: Complications
Human-rights, Environment, National security, Infant Industry

Chapter 10: Foreign aid
Invisible Hand
Humility
Balancing act of foreign aid

Chapter 11: Foreign currencies
Foreign exchange market : supply and demand
Government intervetion => fixed exchange rate, abandoned its own currency
Impossible Trinity: FREELY TRADE CURRENCY, 
INDEPENDENT MONETARY POLICY, FIXED EXCHANGE RATES: Only have two out of three


Part Three: Global Macroeconomics
Chapter 12: The End of Business Cycle
Goldilocks economy
TOP FACTOR CAUSES GREAT DEPRESSION => Bad monetary policy
The financial system: Market failure (bank out of money) & goverment failure (bailout for loanning money)
self fulfilling prophecy

Chapter 13: The End of Poverty
Rich countries, middle-income countries, low-income countries => catch-up
Conditional Convergence (macroeconomist agree on some but not all)
=> poverty trap, big boost, good government, geography
BOTTOM BILLION
=> Relative poverty

Chapter 14: The end of planet earth?
population, rise of economy => global warming, pollution
both optimistic, pessimistic are wrong

Chapter 15: The end of youth?
Aging => social security, medicare,
Young work, old get => PAYGO => bucket bridgade is headed for a breakdown.
=> Three painful options: cut benefits, increase taxes, borrow the money
=> Tow relative painless (big challenges): 
finding cheaper ways to provide health care, grow our way out of our financial problems

Chapter 16: The end.
Diffences between problem of micro and macro:
+ macro is having more trouble to taming its monster
+
