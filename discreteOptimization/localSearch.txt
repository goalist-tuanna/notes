Local move from this configuration to that configuration
Constrast with constraint programming

Satisfaction Problems:
- Use Max/Min - Conflict: 
+ choose a decision variable that appear in the most violations
+ assign to a value that minimize its violations

Swap:
- Maintain hard constraints, try soft constraints
- Need good model about voliation to provide insight information

Many ways to choose neighbours
Examples:
- Warehouse location: Open and close, swap
- Travelling salesman: 2-OPT, 3-OPT, 4-OPT, .... more => more better but more expansives,
  K-OPT (sequence of swaps)
